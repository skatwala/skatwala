# 👋 Hi, I'm Saptarshi Katwala  

**AI Compliance & Governance Leader**  
Helping enterprises deploy AI responsibly across healthcare, finance, and regulated industries.  

---

## 🛡️ What I Do
I build **reference architectures** and **compliance guardrails** for AI systems — enabling organizations to scale AI without risking privacy, auditability, or regulatory failure.  

My work lives at the intersection of:  
- **Governance** – GDPR, HIPAA, GxP, EU AI Act, bias/fairness audits  
- **Architecture** – Databricks, FastAPI, Delta Lake, MLflow, Unity Catalog  
- **Translation** – bridging Privacy, Legal, HR, Compliance, and Engineering teams
